# This repository contains my Python learning journey through an intensive 3-week course. It includes foundational programming concepts, 
# intermediate topics, and practical projects demonstrating my growing proficiency in Python.

# Throughout the course, I worked extensively with popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, cryptography, and hashlib to handle data processing, visualization, and basic cryptographic operations. 
# The projects showcase my ability to write clean, well-structured, and functional code while solving real-world problems.

# This portfolio serves both as a personal reference and a demonstration of my commitment to continuous learning and skill development in Python programming.
